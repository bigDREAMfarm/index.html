		<h2> July 24, 2017 - The start of the blog!</h2> 
		<p>
			Well we have to start somewhere in every part of this adventure, so today we start a little blog about what is going on At the farm and what all my dreaming may consist of  for the future!
			My intention when talking Ryan into buying property was just to have a bunch of whatever I wanted...... did not know at the time what that was but I knew I would figure it out! One thing I am known to do is get an idea and jump off the cliff too quickly with it but somehow land on my feet having fun! Over the last year and a half we have grown from the simplest of a few chickens, dogs and feral children all the way to llamas, goats, sheep, and bees! A year ago anything I couldn't afford to buy I would bring home! Now I have decided what I love, what my focus is and I am a little more particular what I bring home as to whether it fits in my plan!
		</p>
		<p>
			The "plan"
			Fiber.....Milk....Meat!
			If you don't serve one of those purposes you probably won't come home with me! ( ...well unless they are just really cute!) We have had our first shearing season this spring and sent it out to the fiber to the mill to be processed. This is something I am learning and hoping to grow. I have a lot to learn from how to shear and process and then spin before I can have beautiful hand spin yarn.
		</p>
		<p>
			Milk! Milking lifestyle hopes to start next spring summer once my beautiful nubian goat Annabelle is old enough to breed! I am super excited for this since I have found it super fun to learn to make cheese and goat milk soap! (The soap is still a work in progress!)
		</p>
		<p>
			Meat!
			No one likes to talk about where their meat comes from and can't believe that we eat our animals! Well here is my opinion... I am raising them to eat. I give them a healthy, free, and loving life while they are here! I love being able to know what life my animals have had and what I am feeding my family. Not all have to agree with what we are doing but it takes all kinds of people and ideas to make the world turn!
		</p>
		<p>
			That is a quick step into my general dream so keep checking back and I will post with what new is going on and what I am learning next!
