	<h2> Chickens and turkeys and ducks... oh my.</h2>
		<p>We raise our free range chicken, turkeys and ducks for four primary purposes.  They provide eggs, free range on insects including ticks and mosquitoes, provide a very good fertiler to add back into our soil and are a source of meat for our table.</p>
