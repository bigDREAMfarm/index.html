		<h2> Getting started</h2>
			<p>
			We started our dream with zero knowledge how to build and manage a farm so we are reliant on information and advice from several sources.  The important consideration to make is that there are multiple different opinions and solutions to any problem.  That being said you ultimately have to go with your gut and trial and error will test it.  
			<ol>
				<li>Utilize the sites below for a quick reference.  Many topics and lots of good solutions provided.</li>
				<li>Seek local farmers that have knowledge specific to your area.  One successful way is to go though local farmers markets and animal swaps in your area.  Farmers markets are usually advertised by the city chamber of commerce and feed stores typically host animal swaps once a month.</li>
				<li>Search for your local ag-extension office and identify and opportunites they may have for you to learn.</li>
			</ol>
