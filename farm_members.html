		<p> We are very excited for you to meet the members of our farm family and focus area's.  Our farm members have many purposes that are intertwined but each has very important role in our goal.  Each member is also unique in their own little ways.  Just watching and interacting with them can yield hours of entertainment.

	<h2><link <a href = "llamas">Llamas</a></link> </h2>
		<p>  We utilze our Llama's for three primary purposes.  They protect our herd, assist with pasture managment and their dung serves as a soil conditioner that does not burn up plants (perfect for our garden).</p>
	
	<h2><link <a href = "goats">Goats</a></link> </h2>
		<p>  We have three different types of goats including Pygmie, Nubian and Angora.  Generally speaking they assist with four primary purposes.  They  are excellent companion animals for eachother, more brush and leaves vs. grass, their wool can be spun into yarn, and can be milked.</p>
	
	
	<h2><link <a href = "sheep">Sheep</a></link> </h2>
		<p>Our Southdown Babydoll Sheep also have three primary purposes.  Their fiber can be spun into yarn, they are excellent grazers for pasture management and can be an excellent source of meat for the table.</p>
	
	
	<h2><link <a href = "birds">Birds</a></link> </h2>
		<p>We raise our free range chicken and turkeys for four primary purposes.  They provide eggs, free range on insects including ticks and mosquitoes, provide a very good fertiler to add back into our soil and are a source of meat for our table.</p>
	
	
	<h2><link <a href = "bees">Bee's</a></link> </h2>
		<p>The bee's certainly pull their weight on the farm.  They provide honey and assist with the pollination of local flowers and our garden</p>
	
		
	<h2><link <a href = "garden">Garden</a></link> </h2>
		<p>  Durring the summer months we put a big focus on our garden for fresh produce and ensure that any extra gets stored for the winter by canning and dehydrating.</p>
