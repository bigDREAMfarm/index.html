		<h2>Our begining</h2>
			<p>
				It seems like just yesterday that we were looking to start a new chapter for our family.  We felt something calling us to try something new and everything just seemed to fall into place.  We had orginally been looking for property on 3-5 acres with the goal of having a couple animals and space to produce for ourselves.  Little did we know we would find the home on 19.5 acres to start our dream.
			</p> 
			
		<h2>How did we get here?</h2>
			<p>
				It all started with chickens.... About a year before starting our new chapter, we had built a small chicken coop with plans from backyardchickens.com (recommended sites) in our backyard. The City regulations allowed for us to have 13 hens so of course we had to raise up 13 chicks of multiple varieties.  Little did we know that this would be the gateway animal that was the driving force to our current state today.
				
				We would also not want to forget the many resources and people/enablers that have helped get us to where we are today.  This is critical as we started with zero previous experience.  Please review our recommended sites page for a quick reference and contact us if you have any that you have found extremely helpful that we should include. We do have a standard set of go to sites but find new ones frequently.
			</p>
			
		<h2>Our philosophy</h2>
			<p>
				First and foremost everything we do at the bigDREAMfarm must have a purpose.  
				
				Here are some examples:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>bedding from the chickens goes back into the soil for our garden.</li>
				<li>livestock poop is spread out with the harrow to fertilize our pasture</li>
				<li>dogs are being trained as livestock guardians</li>
				<li>wool from sheep and lammas are being spun into yarn</li>
				<li>livestock is rasied up and butchered as we need for our table</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				Second we educate starting with our kids.  It is important for them to understand where their food comes from and how we take care of and treat our livestock. We also welcome locals by appointment to come see what we have and to learn about the animals.  
				
				Third we focus on identifying livestock and produce that we can use in replacement of items from the store. For example we make our own salsa, pizza sauce butcher our own chickens if possible.
			</p>
							
		<h2>ALL IN</h2>
			<p>
				In less than two years, we have have grown from 13 hens to 75-100 chickens, turkeys, ducks, goats, sheep, and lammas.  We also have two bee hives.  We learn something new every day and work hard support bigDREAMfarm.  As we have free time, we work to enhance the area's.  This includes building additional shelters, enhancing the existing shelters, managing the pasture space and in the summer working our 1/4 acre garden.  There is never a slow day but we wouldn't have it any other way.
